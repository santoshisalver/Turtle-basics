# Turtle Graphics Animations: Star and Square

This repository contains two Python scripts that use the Turtle graphics library to create animated drawings: one for drawing a square and the other for drawing a star.
Both programs use loops and basic Turtle commands to create these shapes in a fun and interactive way.

## Files

- **square_animation.py**: A script that draws a square using Turtle graphics.
- **star_animation.py**: A script that draws a star using Turtle graphics.


**Expected Output**:  
An animated drawing of a square, where the Turtle moves forward and turns right 90 degrees after each step.
